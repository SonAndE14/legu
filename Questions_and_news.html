                    <p>Why the name Life Light was changed to Rearmed?
                    </p>
                    <p>It was changed because the idea didn't make a bit of sense and it was boring. As a result, the decision was made to change it to Rearmed, leaving fixed the main idea of ​​the NFTs that they currently know. Rearmed brings together ideas and knowledge from developed projects to form a single and improved one.
                    </p>
                    <p>Why are these NFTs given away for free?
                    </p>
                    <p>We believe it is important to make entry into the NFTs as easy as possible for everyone. It's a lot of fun and not only do we enjoy NFTs, but we see great potential in them as well. The free distribution seems like a good way for us to grow the community and help new people get started with NFTs. Unfortunately for many people joining the space, the idea of ​​buying digital art or NFT is hampered because the process is not very easy, and the sheer number of projects and assets initially can be quite overwhelming. That is why we only offer to give them some free cards to play and educate them on how to receive, send or exchange NFT on the example of Rearmed.
                        The free distribution comes with its own challenges. The team has generously donated their time to the project without expecting a profit, but the domain name, server hosting, and chain card minting are not free. To try and offset these costs, there is currently a 6% merchant fee for aftermarket Rearmed card exchanges at Wax
